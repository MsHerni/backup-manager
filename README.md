## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File

The configuration file is generated during installation. This file has multiple sections for customizing backups.

*‚ö†Ô∏è The script loads the configuration file at startup. If you make changes to the configuration file (`conf.ini`), you must restart the systemd service for the changes to take effect.*

Example of conf.ini:
```ini
[settings]
; General settings for backup configuration

; Interval in hours between backups
; You can choose a float value for smaller intervals (e.g., 0.5 for 30 minutes)
; Default value is 24 (Hours)
BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS = 24


[destination]
; Define the destination of the backup files.
; Supported destination type(s): TELEGRAM, SERVER

; TELEGRAM Section
; TOKEN and CHAT_ID are required; TOPIC_ID is optional.
; --------------------
TYPE = TELEGRAM
TOKEN = your_telegram_bot_token
CHAT_ID = your_chat_id
TOPIC_ID = your_topic_id  # optional

; SERVER Section
; Everything is required.
; --------------------
TYPE = SERVER
SERVER_IP = your_remote_server_ip
SERVER_PORT = your_remote_server_port
SERVER_USER = your_remote_server_user
SERVER_PASSWORD = your_remote_server_password # i know its not ideal
SERVER_FOLDER = your_remove_server_destination_path


[backup]
; Define the backup main options.

; FILES_BACKUP: Set to true to enable, false to disable
FILES_BACKUP = true

; BASE_DIRS: List of directories to back up, separated by commas
BASE_DIRS = /var/www, /home/user/documents

; EXCEPTION_DIRS: Directories within BASE_DIRS to exclude, separated by commas
EXCEPTION_DIRS = */vendor

; SQL_BACKUP: Set to true to enable, false to disable
; Supported structures: MySQL, MariaDB
SQL_BACKUP = true

; SQL_BASE_DBS: Databases to back up, default "". Exclusions should be defined in SQL_EXP_DBS
; Use "" for all databases or list specific databases separated by commas.
SQL_BASE_DBS = database1, database2

; SQL_EXP_DBS: Databases to exclude from backup, separated by commas
; These databases are excluded by default: information_schema, performance_schema, mysql, sys, test
SQL_EXP_DBS = excluded_db1, excluded_db2

; WEBSERVER_BACKUP: Set to true to enable, false to disable
; Supported servers: Apache, nginx
WEBSERVER_BACKUP = true
```

## üõ† Systemd Service Management

The script uses a Systemd service to run in the background and schedule backups automatically. Here are some useful commands for managing the service:

- Start the service:
```bash
systemctl start backup
```

- Stop the service:
```bash
systemctl stop backup
```

- Restart the service (required after configuration changes):
```bash
systemctl restart backup
```

- Check the status of the service:
```bash
systemctl status backup
```
